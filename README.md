# 🌐 IoT Class 2025 — Sensor Simulation Project

This project provides a complete example of a simulated IoT data pipeline using Docker. It includes:

- **IoT Publisher**: Publishes sensor data (e.g., temperature, humidity) to a message broker (e.g., Kafka, MQTT).
- **IoT Subscriber**: Subscribes to the broker and processes or logs incoming sensor data.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hanattaw/Iot-class-2025-sensor
cd Iot-class-2025-sensor
````

---

## 📡 Run IoT Publisher

```bash
cd iot-publisher
docker compose up --build --remove-orphans
```

To stop and remove:

```bash
docker compose down -v
```

More details in [`iot-publisher/README.md`](./iot-publisher/README.md)

---

## 📡 Run IoT Subscriber

```bash
cd iot-subscriber
docker compose up --build --remove-orphans
```

To stop and remove:

```bash
docker compose down -v
```

More details in [`iot-subscriber/README.md`](./iot-subscriber/README.md)

---

## 📦 Broker Configuration

The publisher and subscriber assume that a Kafka or MQTT broker is running. You can:

* Use your own external broker (set in `.env`)
* Or extend this project to include a broker container (e.g., `kafka-docker`, `emqx`)
